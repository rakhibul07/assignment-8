Three features of my project are given below:

1.Search Functionality: My website includes a search feature that allows users to search for content or items based on categories. Users can filter and find specific information easily.

2.Donation Tracking: My website features a pie chart that visually represents total donations and individual user donations. This helps users track the progress of donations and see their personal contributions compared to the overall total.

3.Responsive Design: My website is designed to be responsive, meaning it adapts and looks good on various devices, including desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones. This ensures a seamless user experience across different screen sizes and resolutions.
